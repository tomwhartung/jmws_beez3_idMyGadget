# jmws_beez3_idmygadget
I am using this repo to integrate the default joomla Beez3 template with idMyGadget.

## Dependencies
To function properly, this code requires installation of code in other reqpos.

### Required: jmws_idMyGadget_for_joomla
For this template to work properly, the jmws_idMyGadget_for_joomla must be installed.

Note that although jmws_idMyGadget_for_joomla comes with a very simple device detector (detect_mobile_browsers) installed "out of the box," it works best when you add one or more of the more sop
histicated third-party device detection tools.

Fret not, however!  You can accomplish much of this by running one or more "git clone" commands.

For information on how to install this required code, see the jmws_idMyGadget_for_joomla README.md file.

## Status:
This is a work in progress (WIP), so anything but minimal documentation would be premature at this time.

## Installation:

-------------------------------------------------
Consider making generic installation instructions
-------------------------------------------------
1. git clone this repo

2. use back-end Joomla Discover process

3. Install dependencies

Optional: using ln_joomla script!


## Beez3 Parameters:

(Keep it minimal)

## Parameters Added by jmws_beez3_idMyGadget:

(It would be nice to have the site set up with demos and screen shots, so we can refer to all that.)
