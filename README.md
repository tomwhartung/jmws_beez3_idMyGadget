# jmws_beez3_idmygadget
I am using this repo to integrate the default joomla Beez3 template with idMyGadget.

## Dependencies
To function properly, this code requires installation of code in other reqpos.

### Required: jmws_idMyGadget_for_joomla
For this template to work properly, the jmws_idMyGadget_for_joomla must be installed.

Note that although jmws_idMyGadget_for_joomla comes with a very simple device detector (detect_mobile_browsers) installed "out of the box," it works best when you add one or more of the more sop
histicated third-party device detection tools.

Fret not, however!  You can accomplish much of this by running one or more "git clone" commands.

For information on how to install this required code, see the jmws_idMyGadget_for_joomla README.md file.

### Highly Recommended: jmws_mod_menu_idMyGadget
For best results, install the jmws_mod_menu_idMyGadget module.

This is required for the hamburger (aka "PhoneBurger") menu to work, and your joomla site will probably whitescreen if you try to create a Hamburger Menu and this module is not present.

## Status:
This is a work in progress (WIP), and pretty much on hold for now.

Right now I am focused on the jmws_protostar_tomh_idMyGadget template, and after that am planning to do similar work in WordPress and Drupal.

There's no real reason to continue work on this, without a specific goal in mind and a compelling reason to prefer starting with Beez3 rather than jmws_protostar_tomh_idMyGadget .  I have neither.

However, I'd be happy to return to work on this, for a fee!  ;-)

## Installation:

Installation of all jmws_* joomla extensions is the same.
