# jmws_beez3_idmygadget
I am using this repo to integrate the default joomla Beez3 template with idMyGadget.

## Status:
This is a work in progress (WIP), so anything but minimal documentation would be premature at this time.

## Installation:

(Discover)

## Beez3 Parameters:

(Keep it minimal)

## Parameters Added by IdMyGadget:

(It would be nice to have the site set up with demos and screen shots, so we can refer to that.)


## About IdMyGadget:

For information about the IdMyGadget Device Detection Adapter API&copy;, see the [About-IdMyGadget.md file in this directory](https://github.com/tomwhartung/jmws_beez3_idMyGadget/blob/master/ABOUT-IdMyGadget.md).
